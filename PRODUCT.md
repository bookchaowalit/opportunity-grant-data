# Data Product Charter

## Document control

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Data product ID/version | book-grant-data / grant.v1 demo and grant.v2 source pilot |
| Product owner | bookchaowalit |
| Data owner/steward | bookchaowalit |
| Producer team | Domain repository |
| Status/review date | Local source pilot / 2026-09-07 |
| Evidence boundary | schema.json, demo.json and tests in this repository |

## Runtime status (verified 2026-10-22)

| What | Status |
|---|---|
| Capture entry point | `python -m book_grant_data.capture acquire|records|status` (needs `SOLO_DATA_LAKE_ROOT`, the shared `discovery.capture_runtime` v1 in data-lake-pipelines) |
| Who calls it | data-lake-pipelines `infra/scripts/discovery/portfolio.py acquire` for the 7 enabled source IDs in `systems/architecture/discovery-portfolio-v1.json`; that portfolio is wired to a 6-hourly Windows task (`setup_windows_task.ps1`). Whether the task is installed and running is **not verified** from this repo (owner decision D6 on the schedule host is open) [ต้องยืนยัน] |
| Hosted deployment | None. No port, no API, no cloud job |
| Error reporting | Sentry, opt-in: install the `sentry` extra and set `SENTRY_DSN`; a capture run that exits non-zero sends one event tagged `source_id` (no payload, no PII). No DSN is configured for this product yet [ต้องยืนยัน] |
| Contract | `book_grant_data` `schema.json` (v1 demo) and `schema-v2.json` (captured records); domain-owned, not part of the frozen `data-product-contracts-v2.yaml` port map (the old `opportunity.v1` synthesis is retired, BOO-248) |
| Quality gates in CI | ruff, ruff format, mypy (gradual, see pyproject), offline pytest with coverage ≥ 91%, CLI smoke on Python 3.10 and 3.13, shared security scan |

## Product contract

- Decision or user outcome: Find non-equity project funding and its reporting obligations.
- Consumers and use cases: Discovery applications; integration planned.
- Source systems and lake layers: Seven reviewed official sources → landing → Bronze through the shared local runtime (manual acquisition); synthetic fixtures remain for offline contract tests.
- In scope/out of scope: Project funding calls; individual tuition goes to scholarship and cohort admission to startup-program.
- Freshness, availability, and volume expectation: Target source review every 24h; open filter rejects checks older than 72h; no live SLA.
- Data classification, residency, retention, and access: Public program metadata and synthetic fixtures; no user profile; raw source bytes remain in the private local operational archive.
- Quality thresholds and incident route: All contract tests pass; live quality/replay gates pending; owner handles source failures.
- Cost/capacity guardrail: Manual local capture only; six-hour source cooldown and max 10,000 records per envelope.
- Versioning, deprecation, and migration policy: Draft v1; breaking changes version separately; no legacy migration or live consumer yet.

## Acceptance and ownership

| Gate | Evidence | Owner | Result/status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Contract | Versioned schema and compatibility rules |  |  |
| Quality | Checks and threshold report |  |  |
| Lineage | Source-to-consumer map |  |  |
| Access/privacy | Classification and access review |  |  |
| Operations | Runbook, alert, replay, and recovery |  |  |

## Approval

| Role | Name/date | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| Product/data owner |  | Approve charter / revise |
| Producer owner |  | Accept delivery boundary |
| Consumer representative |  | Accept use and SLA |
